# Loulou's DLL Injector

**LDI** is a straightforward Windows application that allows you to inject a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) into a running process. Whether youâ€™re a developer testing your code or someone looking to modify an application, this tool provides an easy way to accomplish that task. ***LDI uses the Win32 API, which makes this only compatible with Windows.***

*I made a template from the DLL that was used while programming that tool so you cna compile your own one! Just [click here](https://github.com/LoulouNoLegend/DLL-Template)*
